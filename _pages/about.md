I am a research assistant in [Robotics Innovsation Lab (RIL)](https://cpdm.iisc.ac.in/ril/) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), working under the guidance of [Prof. Abhra Roy Chowdhury](https://sites.google.com/view/abhraroychowdhury/) on designing and developing a bio-inspired heterogeneous multi-robot system for a manufacturing environment. I finished my undergraduate studies at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras in July 2020. I was advised by [Prof. T. Asokan](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~asokan/) for my thesis focused on simulating Active multi-robot SLAM in an underwater environemnt using Ant Colony Optimization(ACO).
